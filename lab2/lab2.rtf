1.
  a. 004011A0 is the address which I assume is Main.
  b.
    1. There's a loop. I see a couple subcalls which do various things like checking for internet access and attempting to contact a website. 
    2. Yes, A couple of good ones. http://reversing.rocks/, POST which indicates that it will be sending data, and FindNextFileA which suggests it will be searching / writing files.

2.
  a. hInternet, lpszServerName, nServerPort, lpszUsername, lpszPassword, dwService, dwFlags, dwContext
    1. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384363(v=vs.85).aspx
      Specifically, they set the username and password as well as the serverport. They provide an internet handle to connect to with hhandle. 
  b. It attempts to open an internet connection and if succesful it calls another subroutine
    1. There are two if statements and a subroutine call.
3.
  a. There are three if statements and three loops.
  b. FindFirstFileA, HttpOpenRequest, HttpSendRequestEXA, InternetWriteFile, FindNextFileA, HttpEndRequestA, InternetCloseHandle, FindClose
  c. This subroutine looks for any and all files nonrecursively in the directory and sends only the filenames to a server identified by reversing.rocks.
4. It non-recursively maps out the filesystem in the current directory and sends that data back to the external server reversing.rocks.

1.AllocConsole, FindWindowA, ShowWindow, fopen, time, fputs, ctime, fclose
  a.
    AllocConsole: Allocates a new Console.
    FindWindowA: Returns Handle to the top level window.
    ShowWindow: Assigns a window's visibility state.
    fopen: Opens a file.
    time: Returns the time.
    fputs: Writes to a file.
    ctime Returns an absolute time.
    fclose: Closes a file.
  b. There's a bunch of strings which represent various keyboard characters suggesting a keylogger. Also the string: "logging" as well as several keywords from emails such as TO / FROM ect. 
2.
  a.fopen, fputc, fputs, fclose, ftell, getAsyncKeyState, 
  b. There's a gigantic switch statement / loop to monitor your keyboard inputs.
3.
a.Looking in the //WINDOWS// folder should reveal two files, lzwz.av and lzwindowlz.av. These contain the logs of data captured.
  1. These are useful signatures because they concretely show what data has been collected and prove that you have or have not been infected.
b. It creates two log files lzwz.av and lzwindowlz.av to store the sensitive data it has collected.
