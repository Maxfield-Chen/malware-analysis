PART A:
1.
  Uses fs[0] which provides a pointer to the exception list. This allows it to execute code during an exception as the next call is a div by 0
  Random padding which looks like commands between functions
  Also uses magic numbers to jump to function offsets within data. This allows it to call functions without passing any information and avoids xrefs.
2. 
  rtdsc Timing check
  call is made to isDebuggerPresent: at 1329
  Uses fs[0] which provides a pointer to the exception list. This allows it to execute code during an exception as the next call is a div by 0
3.
  Checks to see if it is being debugged in all the ways listed above. If it is being debugged it will either exit or divide by zero depending on which method was triggered. This will crash the debugger. 
  Eventually once the two checks pass, we will find a function which modifies the execption response table using fs[0] and immediately triggers a div by 0 exception.
    -During the exception handling code, it gets the host's user name, then writes into kingkai.bat which is a program ran under this path: "USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/" This will run the bat file on startup.
    -Inside this file it writes the following command: @echo off\nshutdown /s /f /t 0\n. This will cause the computer to shutdown as soon as it is booted up.


Some notes for Part B:

1331 isdebuggerpresent (Patched)
1309 rtdsc (Patched)

1365 address of div 0
Address of Execption Handling Code: 13B0

The Included Patched Executable will work but remember to set a hardware breakpoint and to disablbe olly's automatic handling for div by 0.
