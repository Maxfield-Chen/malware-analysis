Part A: 
  -PCB / PRCB 
    -Process State
    -Process Number (also called Process Id)
    -CPU-Scheduling Info
    -Program Counter
    -Processor Status
    -Registers
    -Memory Management Info
    -Open Files or Other I/O Status Information
    -Accounting Info
  The PRCB is used to manage information about processes inside of the operating system. The information it holds is crucial to the formation of common data structures like processor queues and other such scheduling optimizations.
Part B:
  1, Malicious Function called from driver entry Starts at 0x00401000. The hooking happens in several functions called from here.
  2, SIDT, LIDT, are used to modify the IDT. This lets you control or in this case hook interrupt handling.
  3, The malicious function is hooking 0x2E and adding debug through altering the IDT. It is creating new code to be ran before standard interrupt code through changing IDT.
  4, This whole program is inserting a driver into kernel space which modifies the IDT entry for 0x2e such that debug information is printed before standard interrupts are called.
